<h3>Your Task</h3>

<p>Create a class named "MazeSolver" that finds a path from a start room to a destination within a maze using recursion. Each room can have a maximum of four doors, one north, one east, one south, and one west. However, a room may have less than four doors, or none at all.

</p><p>The API for the <code>MazeRoom</code> class is available <a href="https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2014-15/S/1030/guides/MazeSolver/api/MazeRoom.html">here</a>. The class has already been provided as part of the <tt>1030.jar</tt> file. <a href="https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2014-15/S/1030/guides/MazeSolver/1030.jar">Download it here</a> and remember its location. In Eclipse, add the jar to your build path (goto Project &gt; Properties &gt; Java Build Path &gt; Libraries &gt; Add External JARs...). Navigate to the location of the jar, select it, and click "Open".

</p><p>Use the following code to create a class named "MazeSolver":
</p><pre>import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * 	Given a MazeRoom and a room name, the search facility of this class
 * 	will return a path to the desired room, if one exists.
 */
public class MazeSolver
{
	private MazeRoom start;
	
	/**
	 * 	Initializes this object.
	 */
	public MazeSolver()
	{
		start = MazeRoom.buildMaze();
	}
	
	/**
	 * 	Provides access to the maze entrance.
	 * 	@return the entrance to the maze.
	 */
	public MazeRoom getEntrance()
	{
		return start;
	}
	
	/**
	 * 	Finds a path from the current room in the maze to the room with the name
	 * 	provided by <code>goal</code>, if one exists.
	 * 	@param current the current room being searched.
	 * 	@param from the room (just searched) through which this room was entered.
	 * 	@param goal the name of the destination room.
	 * 	@return a path from the current room to the goal (e.g., "A-&gt;F-&gt;G"), or
	 * 		<code>null</code> if no path exists.
	 */
	public String findPath(MazeRoom current, MazeRoom from, String goal)
	{
		// Your code goes here...
		// Hint: When you enter a room (i.e., current) search each connected,
 		// non-null room (using goNorth(), goSouth(), goEast(), and goWest()),
		// except the one from which you just came (i.e., from). Stop when the
		// current room's name is the goal.
		;
		
		
		
		
		
	}

	/**
	 * 	Used to test the functionality of this class.
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		PrintStream out = System.out;
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		MazeSolver ms = new MazeSolver();
		MazeRoom start = ms.getEntrance();
		out.println("The entrance to the maze is room " + start.getName());
		out.print("Enter the destination room name: ");
		String goal = in.next();
		String path = ms.findPath(start, null, goal);
		out.print("The path from " + start.getName() + " to " + goal + " is ");
		out.println(path == null ? "non existent!" : (path + "."));
	}
}
</pre>  
Implement the <code>findPath</code> method and use this code to test your class. Ensure that you know what this code does and how it works.

<p>Note that line 17 calls <code>MazeRoom.buildMaze()</code>. This returns a reference to "A" in the maze illustrated here:
</p><div align="center"><img src="./EECS 1030 - Lab Exercise_files/MazeMap1.png"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Bonus Exercise</h3>

<p>Take your solution tothe exercise above and change line 17 to read <code>start = MazeRoom.buildCyclicMaze();</code>. This generates the maze illustrated below. Run your solution and try to find a path from "I" to "L" or "N" or "B". What happens?
</p><div align="center"><img src="./EECS 1030 - Lab Exercise_files/MazeMap2.png"></div>

<p>The cycles (i.e., loops) in the maze can cause infinite recursive calls. To solve this issue, we can use a set to keep track of the rooms we have already visited. If a room is already in the set, we have already been there, so you do not need to search it (again).

</p><p>Use the following code to create a class named "MazeSolver2":
</p><pre>import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * 	Given a MazeRoom and a room name, the search facility of this class
 * 	will return a path to the desired room, if one exists.
 * 
 * 	The search will succeed, even if the maze contains cycles (i.e., loops).
 */

{
	private MazeRoom start;
	
	/**
	 * 	Initializes this object.
	 */
	public MazeSolver2()
	{
		start = MazeRoom.buildCyclicMaze();
	}
	
	/**
	 * 	Provides access to the maze entrance.
	 * 	@return the entrance to the maze.
	 */
	public MazeRoom getEntrance()
	{
		return start;
	}
	
	/**
	 * 	Finds a path from the current room in the maze to the room with the name
	 * 	provided by <code>goal</code>, if one exists.
	 * 	@param current the current room being searched.
	 * 	@param goal the name of the destination room.
	 * 	@param visited all the rooms already searched.
	 * 	@return a path from the current room to the goal (e.g., "A-&gt;F-&gt;G"), or
	 * 		<code>null</code> if no path exists.
	 */

			HashSet&lt;MazeRoom&gt; visited)
	{
		// Your code goes here...

 		// non-null room (using goNorth(), goSouth(), goEast(), and goWest()),
