The Easiest Problem
-------------------

When students are doing a programming contest, they sometimes forget to look 
at the scoreboard to see which problems are the easiest.  (Hint:  the one 
that has been solved by the most competitors is usually the easiest.)

Anne decides that it is too much trouble to keep checking the scoreboard, 
so she wants to spend the first half hour of the contest writing a programmme 
that will look at the scoreboard for her and tell her which problem is the
easiest.

Input
-----

The input will consist of several instances.

The first line of input will contain a positive integer T, representing the 
number of input instances.

Each input instance will begin with a line that contains two positive integers 
n and m, giving the number of teams competing and the number of problems, 
respectively.
Then, there will be n lines (one line for each competitor).  Each line will
contain a name, followed by m integers representing the time that the 
competitor solved Problem 1, Problem 2, ..., Problem m.
If the competitor has not solved the problem yet, then the time listed will
be 0; otherwise it will be the number of minutes elapsed between the start of
the contest and the time that the competitor solved the problem.

In the first sample input below, Anne has solved no problems, Beatrice solved
problems 2 and 4, and Chuck has solved problems 1 and 2.
Notice that the competitors are not listed in any particular order.

Output
------

For each instance, your programme should produce one line of output
giving the problem that has been solved by the most people.  If there
is a tie for the most-solved problem, give the lowest problem number
that has been solved by the maximum number of competitors.  Ignore
the amount of time competitors needed to solve the various problems.
