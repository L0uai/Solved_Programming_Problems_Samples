Election
--------

Tommy, Stevey and Justin are running for election to the position of
Grand Poobah of the Society of Redundancy Society (SRS).  In the
election, each voter votes for exactly one candidate, who can be
either one of the declared candidates or a write-in candidate.  Thus,
for example, a voter can decide to vote for Lizzie instead of one of
the three declared candidates by writing Lizzie's name on the ballot.
Voting is done via secret ballot.  If one candidate gets strictly more
than half of the votes, he or she is declared the winner.  If not, the
person who got the fewest votes is disqualified, and another round of
voting is performed.  (A candidate who is disqualified in one round
cannot be chosen in a subsequent round, even as a write-in candidate.)

Your job is to look at the votes for one round and determine whether
some candidate got strictly more than half the votes cast. 

Input format
------------

The input file will contain multiple problem instances.

The first line of each instance will contain a positive integer n
(where n <= 1000000), indicating the number of ballots cast.  Each of
the next n lines will contain a single name (consisting only of upper-
and lower-case letters).

The end of the input file will be indicated by an instance with n=0.

Output format
-------------

Your programme should report the name of the person who got a strict
majority (if there is one) or say that there was no strict majority
otherwise.  Use the format shown in the sample output below.
