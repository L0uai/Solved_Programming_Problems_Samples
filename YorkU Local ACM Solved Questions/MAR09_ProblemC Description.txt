Classifying Triangles
---------------------

A triangle can be described by the lengths of its three sides.  However, 
any given three lengths will not necessarily describe a triangle.  In this
problem, you must determine the type of triangle, given three side lengths.

Input		 
-----	

The first line of input will contain a positive integer T < 1000, where T 
denotes the number of test cases.  Each of the next T lines will contain 
three positive integers.  Each integer will be less than 10^9.

Output
------	 

For each case of the input there will be one line of output.  It will be 
formatted as: 
Case #{x}: {triangle type}
where x denotes the case number being processed and {triangle type} is 
the type of the triangle.  {triangle type} will be one of the following, 
depending on the values of the three sides:

Invalid - The three sides cannot form a triangle
Equilateral  - All three sides of valid triangle are equal
Isosceles  - Exactly two of the sides of a valid triangle are equal
Scalene - No pair of sides are equal in a valid triangle.
