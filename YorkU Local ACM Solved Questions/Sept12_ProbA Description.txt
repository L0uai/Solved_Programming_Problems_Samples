Temperature
-----------

Leutonians, being reasonable people, use the Celsius scale for
temperature. However, their neighbours, the Wrightonians use the lesser
known HandEgg scale. Since Leutonians are bad at math, this confuses
them immensely. They only know that anything below 0 HandEgg is too
cold, and above 25 HandEgg is too hot.

Your task is to write a programme that given a temperature in HandEgg
between 0 and 25 (inclusive) converts it to Celsius. If the temperature
in HandEgg is h, the temperature in Celsius is 2 * h - 10.

Input
-----

The input will be a single number h.

Output
------

If the input temperature is below 0 HandEgg, the output must be 

Too cold!

If the input temperature is above 25 HandEgg, the output must be 

Too hot!

In every other case, the output must be only one number (followed by
newline), the corresponding Celsius temperature.
