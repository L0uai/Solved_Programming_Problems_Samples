Disputed Claims
Kyle Pickett works in the county office and is in charge of land ownership in his county. When two
people make claims on the same area of land, it is up to Kyle to determine who is the rightful owner.
All land claims are conveniently in the shape of rectangles aligned along the north-south and east-west
axes. When two people bring in claims, the first thing Kyle needs to do is to determine whether or
not there is any overlap between them. Assuming that A and B are the two claims of land, there are
four scenarios of interest to Kyle: A completely surrounding B, B completely surrounding A, A and
B overlapping (but neither surrounding the other) and A and B not overlapping. The pictures below
show two examples each of all four cases. Note that if A and B intersect at only a point or line they
are considered non-overlapping.

For this problem, you will read in descriptions of two rectangular claims, and determine which of the
four cases is true.

Input
There will be multiple input sets. The first line of the input will be an integer n indicating the number
of input sets. Each input set will consist of a single line containing 8 non-negative integers:
x1A y1A x2A y2A x1B y1B x2B y2B
where x1A, y1A are the coordinates of the lower left corner of A’s claim, and x2A, y2A are the upper
right corner of A’s claim. The remaining four values are the corresponding corners of B’s claim. All
claims will have non-zero area (pretty ridiculous claim otherwise!).

Output
For each input set, output either the phrase A surrounds B, B surrounds A, A and B overlap or A
and B do not overlap. The two claims will never be identical.
